# Topic-Modeling-on-News-Articles

Extraction/identification of major topics & themes discussed in news articles

# Problem Description
In this project your task is to identify major themes/topics across a collection of BBC news articles. You can use clustering algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) etc.

# Data Description
The dataset contains a set of news articles for each major segment consisting of business, entertainment, politics, sports and technology. You need to create an aggregate dataset of all the news articles and perform topic modeling on this dataset. Verify whether these topics correspond to the different tags available.

•	The goal of topic modeling is to identify patterns in a text corpus that correspond to document topics. In this example, we will use a dataset originating from BBC news.
•	The goal is to build a classifier that is able to assign a topic to an uncategorized document
